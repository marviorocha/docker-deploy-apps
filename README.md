# Deployment Server with nginx-proxy  and portainer er

Hello, My name's Marvio Rocha, I'm a simple developer from Brazil than love  docker and docker-compose. This is a simple docker-compose script for build a production deployment with docker.

I make it with a person WordPress installer. But you can put other applications run to join.

## Clone branch portainer

`git clone -b portainer https://github.com/marviorocha/docker-deploy-apps.git `
